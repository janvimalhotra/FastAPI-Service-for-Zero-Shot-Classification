### Code Snippet
{
  "hf_pipeline": "zero-shot-classification",
  "model_deployed_url": "from-truefoundary-dashboard",
  "inputs": "Hi, I recently bought a device from your company but it is not working as advertised and I would like to get reimbursed!",
  "parameters": {
    "candidate_labels": ["refund", "legal", "faq"]
  }
}
# Post request
Send a POST request to the /predict/ endpoint with the desired input.
Response
The response will be a JSON object containing the prediction result.

# Customization
You can customize the code to fit your specific requirements. Here are some points to consider:

Modify the predict function to handle different types of Hugging Face models or pipelines.
Update the endpoint URL and request body structure as needed.
Add additional parameters or keyword arguments based on the requirements of your specific model.
Feel free to explore and adapt the code according to your use case.

That's it! You can now run the FastAPI service, send POST requests to the /predict/ endpoint, and get predictions for zero-shot classification using your Hugging Face model.
